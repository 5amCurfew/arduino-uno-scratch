## About Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that uses simple hardware and software to make interactive projects. With Arduino, you can create anything from a basic LED blinking system to more advanced projects like robots or IoT applications.

For more information about Arduino, visit the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/).

## Getting Started

To begin using Arduino, you'll need:
1. An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
2. Arduino IDE (Download from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
3. Basic electronics components (e.g., LEDs, resistors, sensors, etc.)

Follow these steps to set up your Arduino environment:
1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB. (you can view active serial ports using the command `ls -al /dev/tty.*` in the terminal)
3. Open the IDE and select the correct board under **Tools > Board** (ensure the correct port is selected).
